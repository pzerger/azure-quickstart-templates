TEST CHANGE

This template provisions an environment in Azure for learning Chef.
 
 The following VMs are deployed with their own publicly accessible FQDN's for RDP and SSH Access respectively.
 - Ubuntu Server 14.04 running Chef Server 12
 - Windows Server 2012 R2 running as a Domain Controller
 - Windows Server 2012 R2 non-domain-joined with ChefDK Installed
 - Windows Server 2012 R2 non-domain-joined for use as a Sandbox

All of the VMs deployed in this template are **Standard_D2** to ensure the deployment takes less than 40 minutes. It is possible to deploy smaller VMs using this Template; however **all size possibilities have not been tested!**



This template requires the following parameters which are preconfigured:
